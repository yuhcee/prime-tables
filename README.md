# Prime Table

This is a simple multiplication table of Prime Numbers built using React and TypeScript.

## Thoughts

I didn't necessarily feel that React is the best tool to use for this project.
I actually feel like it is an overkill for achieving the minimum requirement.
However, it is the one I am most comfortable with to deliver this as soon as possible, I have decided to use it.
